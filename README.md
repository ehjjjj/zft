# HW7. Recursion (Regular Expression) Exercise
## This is an Excercise. It is related to HW8.

In this exercise you will learn how to use recursion for solving problems, and regular expressions (RegEx). RegEx is used mainly for pattern-matching, parsing, and filtering. Most importantly it is used by compilers such as gcc (C compiler) to translate the high level language to machine language. https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compiler_design/compiler_design_lexical_analysis.htm

In this exercise you will write three functions, for three different regex formulas rule1(), rule2(), rule3() in pe07.c, define protoypes in pe07.h, in the main() in main.c
